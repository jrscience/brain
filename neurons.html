<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Nerve cells, also known as NEURONS, are the main type of cell found within the nervous system. The brain
    consists of billions of neurons.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">How are neurons assembled to form the nervous system? We can
    think of the pathway something as follows: <b>sensory input --&gt; nervous
    system --&gt; motor output</b></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The nervous system is responsible for SENTIENCE - the
    feeling that <i>the body obeys the mind</i></li>
</ul>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;
    <h3 align="left">Basic structure</h3>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/Blausen_0657_MultipolarNeuron.png" width="817" height="532"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">In its most common form, a neuron consists of a CELL BODY with many <i>projections</i> leading away from it</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Most of these projections are DENDRITES, which collect info <i>
    from</i> other neurons and bring it to the cell body</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">AXONS are much longer - they can be up to 1 meter in length
    - and branch out to make contact with the dendrites of other neurons</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">We can remember the direction of propagation of an
    electrical signal reverse-alphabetically, as: <b>d --&gt; cb --&gt; a</b></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">In most neurons, the axon is protected by a fatty coating
    called MYELIN SHEATH. This increases the speed at which impulses can be
    transmitted along the nerve cell</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">So to reiterate: a neuron collects inputs from other neurons
    (via the dendrites), processes them (in the cell body) and gives an output
    (via the axon) - remember: <b> d --&gt; cb --&gt; a</b></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Neurons are <i>amitotic</i>, meaning they do not divide.
    This means that neurons are not usually replaced, so we are born and die
    with mostly the same neurons</li>
</ul>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;
    <h3 align="left">How are electrical impulses generated?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Recall that an <i>ion</i> is an atom or molecule with a net
    electric charge. Examples include sodium and potassium ions: Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>. Each of
    these started out as a neutral sodium/potassium atom and lost one electron
    to become an ion  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Also recall that in physics, whenever there is a separation
    of charges, an <i>electrical potential</i> <b> </b>exists. Put simply, we know that
    opposite charges attract, so it takes energy to separate them (strictly
    speaking, we say <i>work must be done</i> to separate the two charges)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A neuron exploits the <i>potential energy</i> that exists by
    virtue of the separation of ions between the <i>inside</i> and <i>outside</i>
    of the cell membrane. So if, for example, there exists a greater
    concentration of potassium ions (K^+) on the inside of the cell membrane,
    the net difference in electric charge between the inside/outside will give
    rise to an electrical potential. We say there is a <i>potential difference </i>across
    the cell membrane - called the <i>resting potential </i>of the neuron (keep
    this in mind...)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Now, along the cell membrane ION CHANNELS let through
    specific ions at specific times that would otherwise not be able to traverse
    the cell membrane</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A <i>chemically-gated </i>ion channel opens when a specific <i>neurotransmitter
    </i>binds to it. A <i>voltage-gated </i>channel responds to a change in the
    membrane potential. Finally, a <i>mechanically-gated </i>channel opens when
    the receptor becomes physically deformed</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/ion_channel.png" width="833" height="328">
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">When a signal is received by a neuron, be it from sensory
    input or a neurotransmitter from another neuron, above a certain threshold,
    there will be a <b>change in the membrane potential</b></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The change in membrane potential will cause rapid discharge
    of the potential along the entire length of the neuron - we say the neuron
    has <i>fired</i></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The signal will propagate along the neuron rapidly, before
    reaching a SYNAPSE</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A synapse is the gap between two neurons (or between a
    neuron and an <i>effector cell</i>). This is where communication happens
    (next section)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Finally, everything will reset via <i>repolarisation </i>and
    <i>hyperpolarisation</i>. After these processes have taken place, the
    resting potential is eventually restored, and the same neuron is ready to
    fire again</li>
</ul>
    <p align="left"><img border="0" src="images/ActionPotential.png" width="536" height="537">
    <p align="left">&nbsp;
    <h3 align="left">The synapse</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">As mentioned, when an action potential fires, the impulse
    travels along the axon, to the axon terminals, before coming to the end of
    the neuron</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">In order for the neuron to pass an electrical or chemical
    signal to <i>another</i> neuron (or a target effector cell), the signal must
    traverse a synapse, which is the gap between the two neurons</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">So synapses are how neurons talk to each other</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">There are two types: electrical synapses, and chemical
    synapses, with the latter being the most common</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A chemical synapse works as follows: when the electrical
    signal reaches the end of one neuron, it causes certain chemicals called
    NEUROTRANSMITTERS to be released into the gap (called the <i>synaptic cleft</i>)
    between the neuron and the next neuron it is trying to talk to</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and
    bind to chemically-gated ion channels on the second neuron, causing <i>it</i>
    to fire</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Chemical synapses allow neurons to form <b>circuits </b>within
    the CNS. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie
    perception and thought. They allow the NS to connect to and control other
    systems of the body (words taken from the Wikipedia page)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">In neuroscience, there is a saying: <i><u><b>neurons that <font color="#FF0000">fire</font>
    together, <font color="#FF0000">wire</font> together!</b></u></i></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">What this means is that when we fire the same sets of
    neurons (i.e. activate the same neuronal circuits) over and over again, the connections
    that exist between them become strengthened. The activity of repeatedly
    firing the same neurons is called <i>practice</i> - and it is what allows us
    to become so good at playing musical instruments, solving chess puzzles, and
    playing sports. The more the neurons fire together, the easier it becomes to
    do the same activity next time. One analogy is that it is like a grassy path
    where the more people that walk over it over time, the more pronounced the
    path becomes (since the grass gets flatter)</li>
