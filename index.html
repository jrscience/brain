<hr>
<h2 align="center"><u>Structure and Physiology</u></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The human brain is the single most complex object in the
    known Universe. No computer or astronomical object comes close!</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">According to one study in <i>Nature</i>, the human brain has
    10^15 (1,000,000,000,000,000) connections, and contains roughly the same
    number of neurons as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy (around 100
    billion) (Link: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02208-0" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02208-0</a>)</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">This gives it an estimated memory storage of 2.5 petabytes
    (2.5 million gigabytes). As put in an article in the <i>Scientific American</i>
    (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/</a>),
    &quot;if your brain worked like a digital video recorder in a television,
    2.5 petabytes would be enough to hold three million hours of TV shows. You would have to leave the TV running continuously for more than 300 years to use up all that storage.&quot;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">How much we truly understand about how our brains work is a
    discussion in its own right, but what we do know, and what we have uncovered
    over the years, is astonishing in itself</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A quick note: the <i>brain</i> is distinct from the <i>mind</i>.
    How all the electrical activity that goes in inside the brain gives rise to
    consciousness is a scientific mystery</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Central Nervous System: The Brain and Spinal Cord</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The nervous system is <i>the network of nerve cells and fibres which transmits nerve impulses between parts of the body.</i></li>
  <li>All animals except sea sponges have a true nervous system (NS)</li>
  <li>It is divided into the central nervous system (CNS) and
    peripheral nervous system (PNS)</li>
  <li>NS = CNS + PNS</li>
  <li>CNS = brain + spinal cord</li>
  <li>PNS = everything else</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Early brain development</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Within an embryo, the brain and spinal cord begin as a single NEURAL TUBE</li>
  <li>Expansion begins at the anterior/rostral end giving rise to the three
    primary brain vesicles: prosencephalon (<i>forebrain</i>), mesencephalon (<i>midbrain</i>),
    rhombencephalon (<i>hindbrain</i>)</li>
  <li>The posterior/caudal end becomes the spinal cord</li>
  <li>From the primary brain vesicles, the secondary brain vesicles eventually
    develop</li>
  <li>Prosencephalon (<i>forebrain</i>) --&gt;&nbsp; telencephalon (<i>endbrain</i>)
    + diencephalon (<i>interbrain</i>)</li>
  <li>The <i>midbrain</i> stays as it is</li>
  <li>Rhombencephalon (<i>hindbrain</i>) --&gt; metencephalon (<i>afterbrain</i>)
    + myelencephalon (<i>spinal brain</i>)</li>
  <li>These all develop further to eventually become regions of the ADULT BRAIN</li>
  <li>Two cerebral hemispheres will form the <i>cerebrum</i></li>
  <li>The midbrain and hindbrain segments collectively become the <i>brain stem</i></li>
  <li>Confined to the volume of the skull, folds are produced in the cerebrum (<i>gyrification</i>),
    leading to the familiar picture of the brain</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Brain structure</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Many ways of partioning: all are correct, just slightly different points
    of view</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Can be divided into <b> four main regions:</b> CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES (left
    and right), DIENCEPHALON (located deep within the brain; connects midbrain
    to the much larger forebrain),
    BRAIN STEM, CEREBELLUM</li>
  <li>The brain stem is the most primitive part of the brain, controlling
    &quot;automatic&quot; functions such as breathing and heartbeat</li>
  <li>It consists of midbrain + pons (&quot;pon-z&quot;) + medulla oblongata.
    The medulla oblongata blends into the spinal cord</li>
  <li>The cerebellum (from the Latin - &quot;little brain&quot;) is responsible
    for coordinating voluntary movements</li>
  <li>Most of the brain mass is in the cerebral hemispheres</li>
  <li><b>Each hemisphere is divided into five lobes:</b> FRONTAL, PARIETAL,
    TEMPORAL, OCCIPITAL, and, the INSULA (buried within the lateral sulcus)</li>
  <li>The first four lobes are named after the cranial bones that are adjacent
    to them</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The CORPUS CALLOSUM is a bundle of nerve fibers (~ 200 million) connecting
    the two hemispheres (each containing <i>billions</i> of nerve cells) - think
    of it as a &quot;bridge&quot; between the two hemispheres</li>
  <li>A fascinating area of psychology is in <i>split-brain studies</i>: a split
    brain is one in which the corpus callosum has been severed. This stops the
    two hemispheres from communicating with each other as normal, and can have
    profound effects on perception, thinking and consciousness</li>
  <li>Amazingly, the <i>left </i>hemisphere of the brain controls the <i>right </i>side
    of the body, and similarly the <i>right </i>brain hemisphere controls the <i>left
    </i>side of the body</li>
  <li>Some functions are <i>lateralised</i>, but the left/right brain
    &quot;personality type&quot; is a complete myth</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lobes of the brain</h4>
<ul>
  <li>We now know that most brain functions rely on many different regions
    across the brain working in conjunction, but it is still true that each lobe
    carries out the bulk of certain functions</li>
  <li>Firstly, the FRONTAL LOBE... it is the largest of the four major lobes and
    is found at the front of each cerebral hemisphere</li>
  <li>It is primarily responsible for &quot;higher&quot; cognitive functions:
    memory, regulating emotions, planning, problem solving, social interactions,
    etc.</li>
  <li>As such, the frontal lobe is a big determiner of <i>personality</i>. Story
    of Phineas Gage</li>
  <li>Behind the frontal lobe sits the PARIETAL LOBE (separated by the central
    sulculus)</li>
  <li>It is responsible for integrating sensory information (including touch,
    temperature, pressure and pain) - i.e. <i>making sense of the senses</i>.
    (If you read on to the section on the cortex - note that...) the <i>somatosensory
    cortex</i> is found in the parietal lobe</li>
  <li>The major sensory inputs from the skin (touch, temperature and pain
    receptors) relay through the thalamus to the parietal lobe</li>
  <li>TEMPORAL LOBE (<i>temporal</i> refers to the <i>temples</i>) sits at the
    bottom (beneath the lateral fissure)</li>
  <li>Also processes sensory information and is particularly important for
    hearing, recognising language, and forming memories</li>
  <li>Finally, the OCCIPITAL (&quot;oc-sip-it-al&quot;) lobe sits right at the
    back (its named is derived from &quot;<i>behind the head</i>&quot;) and is
    the major visual processing center of the brain - it contains most of the
    anatomical region of the visual cortex</li>
  <li>It is therefore associated with distance/depth perception, colour,
    object/facial recognition, and also involved in forming memories&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>An interesting sidenote: <b>memory...</b></li>
  <li>As neurobiologist Colin Blakemore (1944-2022) put it - without memory,
    &quot;there could be no language, no art, no science, no culture. Civilization
    itself is the distillation of human memory.&quot;</li>
  <li> Memory is another mental faculty that is not
    particularly well understood. It seems to involve a lot of different brain
    regions working together - there is no distinct &quot;memory region&quot; in
    the brain</li>
  <li>The thalamus and the hippocampus are important, but so too are the <i>amygdalae </i>(plural of <i>amygdala</i>)
    which are heavily involved in emotions</li>
  <li>In the 1960s, research was done on patients undergoing brain surgery. By
    stimulating the exposed cortex (surface of the brain) with tiny electrodes,
    certain memories could be triggered, but, remarkably, the same memories
    could also be triggered by stimulating completely different spots along the
    cortex. The conclusion is that memories are not localised in one region of
    the brain, but instead spread around the cortex (Read on if you don't know
    what the <i>cortex</i> is!)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Another way of looking at it (cross-sectional view)...</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Each hemisphere can be divided into: the CEREBRAL CORTEX (grey matter
    comprising the outermost part of the brain), WHITE MATTER, and, BASAL NUCLEI</li>
</ul>

  </figure>
</center>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grey matter is mainly made of nerve cell bodies and <b>nonmyelinated </b>fibers</li>
  <li>The internal white matter is a dense collection of neurons that have <b>myelinated
    </b>fibers - it is largely composed of axons</li>
  <li>Basal nuclei are regions of grey matter within the white matter</li>
  <li>The cerebral cortex is the most complex and &quot;newest&quot; (most
    recently evolved) of the brain regions</li>
  <li>Is it where <i>consciousness</i> resides???&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Specific regions in the cortex (called DOMAINS) are responsible for
    controlling <i>motor and sensory functions</i></li>
  <li>In other words, certain areas of the cortex control specific functions.
    The highest mental functions like memory and language are <b>spread around
    the cortex, and overlap various domains</b></li>
  </ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Motor areas</b> include the primary motor cortex (controls voluntary
    motion), the premotor cortex (plans and sequences movements, vital in tasks
    such as playing a musical instrument) and Broca's area (controls speech)</li>
  <li>The most delicate voluntary motion occurs in the face, tongue and hands.
    An amazing fact is that we have more nerve endings on the tip of the thumb
    than there are over... the entire back! This gives humans our incredible
    dexterity for manipulating tools, a clear evolutionary advantage!</li>

<ul>
  <li>The thalamus receives and directs all info headed to the cerebral cortex
    (so intimately involved with learning and memory)</li>
  <li>The hypothalamus (&quot;hypo&quot; meaning <i>under</i>) controls the ANS
    (autonomous nervous system), controls body temperature (via the
    thermoregulatory center, situated inside the hypothalamus), hunger/thirst,
    sleep cycles, emotions and endocrine system</li>
  <li>It also houses the pituitary gland which has been appropriately described
    as <i>the conductor of the endocrine orchestra</i></li>
  <li>The epithalamus houses the pineal gland (a remnant of a third eye that
    vertebrates used to have), and helps regulate sleep</li>
  <li><b><u><i><font color="#FF0000">Important note:</font></i></u></b> Nothing
    in the brain is strictly localised! While it's true that some parts play a
    bigger role in, e.g. language, than others, everything your brain does
    depends on many different parts working together - there is no single
    &quot;language spot&quot; for example. Talking about one specific
    &quot;spot&quot; for something is a useful shorthand, but a deliberate
    oversimplification!</li>

  <li>Other types of neuroglia found in the CNS: ASTROCYTES (heavily branched
    cells that attach to neurons, acting as supply lines to absorb and secrete

    OLIGODENDROCYTES (form myelin sheaths)</li>

  <li>The &quot;spongy&quot; appearance of the brain is due to ridges called
    GYRI (&quot;j-i-r-i&quot;), separated by grooves
    called SULCI (&quot;sul-k-i&quot;)</li>
  <li>Deeper grooves are called FISSURES, e.g. the hemispheres are separated by
    the <i>longitudinal fissure</i></li>
  <li>There are also hollow cavities called VENTRICLES filled with <i>cerebrospinal

<ul>
  <li>We should also mention a very important feature called the BLOOD BRAIN
    BARRIER (&quot;BBB&quot; for short), which is exactly as it sounds</li>
  <li>This only lets certain molecules (e.g. oxygen, glucose, psychiatric drugs)
    through, while stopping others and crucially it stops any microorganisms
    such as bacteria, viruses or parasites that might be already circulating in
    the bloodstream from getting through</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Scoop model</h3>
<ul>
  <li>With the exception of sponges, almost all animals have a brain. The human
    brain is the most complex, and our brains are the largest <b>in proportion
    to our body size</b></li>
  <li>As evolution has proceeded, brains have had to become increasingly
    complex, in order to deal with increasingly complex environments</li>
  <li>We share parts of our brain with other animals and, roughly speaking, the
    parts of the brain become more complex and less primitive
    (&quot;newer&quot;, in an evolutionary sense) as we move upwards
    topographically</li>
  <li>The oldest part of the brain is the so-called <i>Reptilian brain </i>(shared
    with reptiles) - comprised of the brain stem and cerebellum. As mentioned,
    these work continuously - 24hrs/day - without us being consciously aware,
    and they control the most basic of bodily functions including heartbeat,
    balance, breathing and body temperature. You never have to
    &quot;remember&quot; to make your heart beat or take a breath - the most
    ancient part of your brain does it for you</li>
  <li>Next we have the <i>Mammalian brain</i> (a.k.a. the <i>limbic system</i>)
    - shared with mammals. It is situated above the brainstem and beneath the
    cortex. The limbic system is heavily tied with emotions.</li>
  <li>Finally, what sets us humans apart is our <i>Primate brain </i>(a.k.a. the
    cortex) - which allows for &quot;higher order&quot; mental functions,
    including language, logical reasoning, imagination, and many others </li>
